# ChennaiWebRequest: Built better chennai

The [ChennaiNerd](https://github.com/ChennaiNerd) is a community of developers creating open source software. This is a place to submit ideas for new projects and to get involved in building them.

## Submitting an idea or request

All individual ideas start life in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ChennaiNerd/ChennaiWebRequest/issues).

Once an idea has been fleshed out and has interest from a group of people who want to work on it, we can create a repository and assign an initial core team to build it. That team will have full control over how the project is executed.

Everyone else is free to submit pull requests to the project's repository and the core team can request that helpful contributors be added to the team.
